    "overview": "Martin Scorsese’s Oscar-winning biopic about the life of film-maker and aviation pioneer Howard Hughes from 1927 to 1947, during which time he became a successful film producer and an aviation magnate while simultaneously growing more unstable due to severe obsessive-compulsive disorder. After a scene from 1914, which may explain his later fear of dirt and disease, the film starts in 1927 during Hughes' filming of the World War I aviation film \"Hell's Angels\". He's 22 years old, has inherited the family's fortune and tool company, but wants to spend his time making film instead. However, he soon finds himself just as involved in the aviation industry, buying an airline and developing new planes.",

Pablo's drug money had turned Andres' national team into South American champions, favored to win the 1994 World Cup in Los Angeles. It was there, in a game against the U.S., that Andres committed one of the most shocking mistakes in soccer history, scoring an \"own goal\" that eliminated his team from the competition and ultimately cost him his life. The Two Escobars is a riveting examination of the intersection of sports, crime, and politics.",

But this prince, Hercules, knows nothing of his real identity or his destiny. He desires only one thing: the love of Hebe, Princess of Crete, who has been promised to his own brother. When Hercules learns of his greater purpose, he must choose: to flee with his true love or to fulfill his destiny and become the true hero of his time. The story behind one of the greatest myths is revealed in this action-packed epic - a tale of love, sacrifice and the strength of the human spirit.",

Hitler, himself, degenerates into a paranoid shell of a man, full of optimism one moment and suicidal depression the next. When the end finally does comes, and Hitler lies dead by his own hand, what is left of his military must find a way to end the killing that is the Battle of Berlin, and lay down their arms in surrender.",

    "overview": "Intervista has been termed a semi-documentary: This is in fact the filmed autobiography of Italian director Federico Fellini, framed in the form of an interview conducted by a Japanese film crew.As the interview progresses, Fellini’s mind wanders to his earliest days (the reenacted events conflict with several of the “official” stories of his life). His fascination with filmmaking is manifested in the “wonderland” atmosphere of the old Cinecitta studios.With the cooperation of Fellini’s loyal co-workers, we are permitted to see tantalizingly brief excerpts (some self-mocking) of Fellini’s modus operandi. A visit by Fellini and guest-star Marcello Mastroianni to Anita Ekberg’s home leads to a lavish (and poignant) “reliving” of the 1961 Fellini/Mastroianni/Ekberg effort La Dolce Vita.The climax of Intervista scene invokes Fellini’s previous inward-looking classic 8 1/2, with a novel twist calculated to send the director’s disciples home with a knowing smile. ~ Hal Erickson, Allmovie",

    "overview": "Sisters Murielle and Victoria are married to men who hate each other -- high-school teacher Bernard and well-to-do Didier, pharmacist in a posh Paris neighborhood. Both chain-smoke, and their wifes lead them to a cigarette challenge as they attempt to stop smoking for two weeks in order to prove who is the better man. Quitting brings on manic mood swings, massive food consumption, insomnia, and a host of habits that alter their lives and threaten their marriages.",
